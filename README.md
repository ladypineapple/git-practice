# Git Basics: Practice

## Reading (Required)

Read the entire [Comparing
Workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows) tutorial
from Atlassian, except for the "Gitflow Workflow" section, which is optional.

It's a solid overview of all the commands we've learned, and an introduction to
different common patterns developers use to save their work with git. Pay
particular attention to the "Feature Branch Workflow". If you don't understand
the workflows themselves, that's OK! Just focus on how the commands are being
used and how the changes they work are visualized. This should take about an
hour.

## Tutorials (Required)

If you have any questions during these tutorials, review your class notes and
our lesson repos. To do that, navigate to the [General Assembly WDI
Boston](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston) organization and use the search box to
find our git repositories.

### CodeSchool's Try Git

First, let's review the basic `git` commands using CodeSchool's excellent, free
[Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) tutorial. This should
take somewhere between 15 and 30 minutes to complete.

### Learn Git Branching

Next, we'll focus on visualizing git commands, especially branching, by working
on [Learn Git Branching](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/). Complete
all the exercises in the following sequences:

-   `Main > Introduction Sequence`, levels 1 and 2
-   `Main > Ramping Up`, all levels

-   `Remote > Push & Pull`, levels 1 through 6
-   `Remote > To Origin and Beyond`, levels 1 and 3

Each level in Learn Git Branching will explain the concepts you are expected to
use to solve the level. Think of these as instructions, and do not skip them!

You'll have an interactive shell to complete each challenge, as well as help
buttons which display your goal and a visualization of what the end goal should
look like.

This will take longer. If you spend more than an hour on this, please let an
instructor know. Some of the [Atlassian Git
Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches) may be good
references if you get stuck.

## Bonus (Optional)

If you need more review, continue by working through the free chapter of
CodeSchool's [Interactive Git
Tutorial](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real).

You may also want to practice targeted review with [Learn Version Control with Git](http://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/),
one of the best intermediate references available for free online. If you're
not satisfied with how well you understand a topic, scan the table of contents
and give yourself a set amount of time to review. After time is up, move on!
This practice is called [timeboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing)
and is a great way to avoid getting off track.

Finally, review some of the great visuals provided at [A Visual Git
Reference](http://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html). These
diagrams are more detailed and offer annotations that may help you understand
how git works. These make a great reference for later, especially if you don't
want to replay [Learn Git
Branching](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/) again.

## Response (Required)

When you've completed all the required exercises, checkout to a new branch 'response' and answer the following questions, placing your answers where prompted. Don't hesitate to add anything else you'd like us to know about your experience with this pactice, or the course so far.

- How do you learn best?
- Combo of reading on my own, practice, group review with a lot of examples, and more practice on my own. My recall works best if I see examples in writing and write them myself several times
-  Which resources from this document helped you the most?
Working with classmates and the resources I found on my own where most helpful
-  Which resource (if any) was most frustrating? Why?
Nothing was particularly frustrating beyond my own inability to understand this.
-   How comfortable are you with the workflow (series of steps and git commands) we use to share work and responses?
4
- Do you have any burning questions about git or how you will use it in this course?
The biggest challenge to me is still initializing the git repository properly. I understand the flow and process but that is still challenging.
